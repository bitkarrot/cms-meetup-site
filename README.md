## Configuration

### Relay Architecture (Two-Tier Strategy)

The application uses a two-tier relay strategy to separate CMS content from social data:

#### Tier 1: Default Relay Only (CMS Content)
Configured via `VITE_DEFAULT_RELAY`. This is the **single source of truth** for all CMS content — both reading and writing. The environment variable always takes precedence over any locally cached or Nostr-stored relay URL.

CMS content that reads/writes exclusively from the default relay:
- Site configuration (Kind 30078)
- Blog posts (Kind 30023)
- Calendar events (Kind 31922, 31923)
- Forms (Kind 30168) and form responses (Kind 30169)
- Static pages (Kind 34128)
- Event RSVPs (Kind 31925)
- Admin dashboard, settings, and system settings
- NIP-65 relay list sync and site config sync

#### Tier 2: Default Relay + NIP-65 Relays (Social Data)
Social and aggregated content fans out to both the default relay and the user's NIP-65 relay list, since this data may not exist on the default relay alone:
- **Feed** (Kind 1 notes) — also includes publish relays if `feedReadFromPublishRelays` is enabled
- **Notes & Note Stats** (Kind 1, reactions, zaps, reposts)
- **Zap Receipts & Analytics** (Kind 9735)
- **Comments** (Kind 1111)
- **User Profiles** (Kind 0) — with `wss://purplepag.es` fallback
- **Direct Messages** (NIP-04 Kind 4, NIP-17 Kind 1059)

The fan-out logic is implemented via `queryWithNip65Fanout()` in `src/lib/queryRelays.ts`, which queries the pool (default relay) and all NIP-65 read relays in parallel, then deduplicates results by event ID.

#### Publishing
All writes always include the default relay. NIP-65 write relays are also included for redundancy. Additional publishing relays can be configured in admin settings for blast publishing.

#### Relay Priority
The `VITE_DEFAULT_RELAY` environment variable **always** overrides any relay URL stored in localStorage or fetched from Nostr events. This prevents stale relay URLs from persisting after switching the default relay.

- **Additional Publishing Relays**: 
  - `wss://relay.damus.io`
  - `wss://relay.primal.net` 
  - `wss://nos.lol`
- **Admin Control**: Admins can dynamically add or remove publishing relays via the system settings.

### Admin Access
Admin access is controlled by a remote `nostr.json` file (configured via `VITE_REMOTE_NOSTR_JSON_URL`). The site automatically detects users and maps roles based on the Master Pubkey.

## NIPs Used

- **NIP-01**: Basic protocol flow
- **NIP-05**: Mapping Nostr keys to DNS-based identifiers
- **NIP-23**: Long-form content for blog posts
- **NIP-47**: Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)
- **NIP-52**: Calendar events for meetups
- **NIP-25**: Event RSVP functionality
- **NIP-57**: Lightning Zaps
- **NIP-nsite (Type 34128)**: Static page mapping
- **NIP-04/17**: Direct messaging support

## Admin Features In-Depth

### Settings Structure
The application uses a layered configuration approach:

1. **Environment Variables (`.env`)**: 
   - Immutable infrastructure keys (Relays, Master Pubkey, Remote Admin JSON).
   - Serves as the hardcoded default state.

2. **Site Settings (Admin UI)**: 
   - Customizable branding (Logo, Title, Description, Navigation).
   - Stored as Replaceable Events (Kind 30078) on Nostr.
   - Overrides defaults when present.

3. **System Settings (Admin UI)**:
   - Administrative configuration (Relay List, Admin Roles).
   - Controls strictly limited to the Master User.

The **Reset to Defaults** feature allows admins to purge the Nostr-based Site Settings and revert to the `.env` configuration.

### Static Pages (Kind 34128)
Admins can create custom URL paths (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`) and upload content (HTML/Markdown) to Blossom. These are mapped using Kind 34128 events, allowing the site to serve decentralized static content.

## Public Features In-Depth

### Community Zapping
Users can send Bitcoin via Lightning Network zaps to authors of blog posts and events. The site supports:
- **WebLN**: Browser extensions like Alby.
- **NWC**: Cross-device wallet connections.
- **QR Codes**: Manual scanning for mobile or desktop wallets.

## Security
- Admin access is cryptographically verified based on the remote `nostr.json`.
- Sensitve configurations are stored in environment variables.
- No private keys are stored on the server; all signing happens via local clients or NWC.
